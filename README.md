# KeyBoardOverlay_AutoDiscoverKeys
Currently being used as a portal to code being provided as a URL link to ChatGPT using the AskYouCode Extension.

Trying to make a program that can be executed from the command line as .EXE to enter key-macro-value configuration from a configuration hub that can be reconfigured and then enabled/disabled from within the "user-interface" portion of the code. 

Main Goal: To compile something that shows me the list of saved configurations inside of the window and be able to select them and activate them for the window environment and have all of the keys work "the way they should".
